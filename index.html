        <p>I am Geovonnie Vasquez, I was born and raised in Arlington Texas.
            My hobbies are weightlifting, playing video games, and watching stand up comedy.
            I like weightlifting beacause it helps improve my health and gives me 
            new goals to achieve. Playing video games help me escape reality. 
            Somtimes life can be stressful and I like to play my favorite game (call of duty)
            to take a break from obstacles. Most of all I love to laugh. stand up comics are genius,
            I think its amazing how somone can talk to a large group of people
            that dont talk back for 2 hours and make them laugh.
            I watch a wide varitey of comedians to help improve my 
            communication skills. I feel this day in age lacks
            people skills that effect our every day and professional lives.</p>
            

            
        <p>   My dream is to manage a devlopment team. Ive played
            football all my life until junior year in high school when I 
            got my 1st after school job at chipotle. I miss motivating and working
            with a team to succeed. We all had a special relationship knowing we 
            been though the same sacrafices and training to get where we are,
            coding brings those same experiences.
            I dont have alot of coding experience yet but I do have alot of ambition.
            I know the game plan to achieve my goals and im willing to do what it takes.</p>
